# Contributing to DevOpsNotebook

**Thank you for taking the time to contribute!!** :tada: :clap:

This project is all about learning, capturing thoughts, and building a guide for myself, potentially others to use. Your PRs are welcome. Fork, update, and push. If the update is worthy then the PR will be accepted. It is important to present information nicely. Thus, it is presented in a Gist and there are some notable contribution guidelines to note.
